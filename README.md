# BAMAZON

**Overview:**
This activity creates an Amazon-like storefront. The app will take in orders from customers and complete the process by checking inventory and presenting one of the following responses:
1. 'The product you requested is in stock! Placing order...'Your order has been placed! Your total is $xxx.xx...'Thank you for shopping with us!''
2. 'Sorry, this item is out-of-stock. Please select another item.'

### Have Fun and Thanks for Playing :)
